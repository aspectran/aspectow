# Aspectow Enterprise Edition

Aspectow Enterprise Edition is a comprehensive, all-in-one web application server built on the powerful Aspectran framework. It is designed for building robust, scalable, and maintainable enterprise web applications. Aspectow comes with a pre-configured environment, allowing you to focus on your application logic instead of server setup.

- **JSP Support**: Integrated with Apache Jasper for seamless JSP development.
- **Enterprise-Ready**: Designed for building and deploying mission-critical enterprise applications.

## Building from Source

Follow these steps to build Aspectow from the source code:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/aspectran/aspectow.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh

3.  **Build the project with Maven:**
    This will compile the source code and package the application.

## Running the Server

Once the project is built, you can start the server using the Aspectran Shell.

1.  **Navigate to the `bin` directory:**
    ```sh
    cd app/bin
    ```

2.  **Start the Aspectran Shell:**
    ```sh
    ./shell.sh
    ```
    This will launch an interactive shell for managing the server.

3.  **Access the application:**
    Once the server is running, you can access the default web application in your browser at [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081).
